This repository contains the static design prototype for VoiceForge — a service that will let users upload files and generate MP3s via AI. This commit adds a modern single-page design with a large hero banner, feature cards, a mock upload UI, and a notify form (no backend functionality implemented).

Files added:
- `index.html` — main landing page and UI prototype
- `css/styles.css` — styling and responsive layout
- `js/main.js` — tiny client-side helpers for UI interactions

Next steps:
1. Implement backend file upload and processing API
2. Add secure storage & job status endpoints
3. Integrate an AI TTS engine and MP3 generation pipeline
